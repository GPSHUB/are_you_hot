## Project Topic:

This is a Machine Learning Project. We built a model to predict if a person is hot or not based on physical
characteristics of celebrities from IMDb website "100 Most Beautiful People on the Planet!" [here](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls066164634/)
and "Ugly Celebrities" [here](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls064405717/) lists.

## Introduction:

* For this project, we took the physical characteristics of the 200 celbrities and created a database.
* The characteristics included, height, weight, eye color, hair color, age, gender, tattoos, distinctive features, zodiac sign.
* We used the database data to build a machine model that categorizes input characteristics from a user and decides whether the input data reflects "Hot" or "Not".
* We utilized 6 of the characteristics to train the model. The 6 features used were height, weight, age, eye color, gender, and distinctive features.

## Analysis:

* Built front-end user interface with Flask for user to interact with a predictive machine learning model.
* Created our own data and Build our own database. Build a Flask App and Launched the app to Heroku.
* Model is based on physical characteristics of celebrities from IMDb "100 Most Beautiful People on the Planet" & "Ugly Celebrities" lists.
* We built bar and pie charts to show how the physical charactaristics distribution and how that effect our model.
* ### IMPORTANT! The model is NOT an indicator of true attractiveness, as that is subjective, rather the model makes predictions based on the two IMDb lists.
